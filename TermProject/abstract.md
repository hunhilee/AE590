# Korean Road Recognition using  Reconnaissnace Drone

## Abstract

The civilian drones are useful  in a wide variety of tasks such as reconnaissance. However the deployment in urban environments has so far been limited because of collision and highly dynamic scenarios. Even though SLAM method has been studied for long time, this technology cannot cover unstructured scenarios. Recently, the data-driven approach like DNN become popular. However, it is not suitable for the local road because this training data to learn road or trail recognization is based on europe road.

### Approach

- step1: make the local road dataset
- step2: run and compare related studies
- step3: improve the system
