# Korean Road Recognition using  Reconnaissnace Drone

## Abstract

The civilian drones are useful  in a wide variety of tasks such as reconnaissance. However the deployment in urban environments has so far been limited because of collision and highly dynamic scenarios. Even though SLAM method has been studied for long time, this technology cannot cover unstructured scenarios. Recently, the data-driven approach like Dronet[1] become popular based on big data However, it is not suitable for the local road because this training data to learn road or trail is based on europe road data which is different from local road. In addition, this network model just thinks of navigation using road recognition as regression problem and don't consider uncertainity. In this term project, we will make the local road dataset with direction information in specific area (KARI road) and compare with previous research result. Then, we improve road recognition network model.

### Approach

- step1: make the local road dataset
- step2: run and compare related studies
- step3: improve the system
